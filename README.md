# What this project is...
- This is a spotify web application made with python. 
- With styled GUI, going for a Analog CRT TV / Cyberpunk / Modern retro interface.
- This is ONE of many of the smaller web app projects that I will at some point combine for my DYI car interface
- Currently still being developed so there is some junk code in MAIN, but it is a working build as of Dec 1st

# Why I wanted to do this project...
- A way for me to learn more about PYQT app development and keep up with my skills on a big project that I would be proud to use and show the world.
- This will at some point go into a bigger projecct of mine - DIY Car Touch Screen Interface
  - when I have some more money for the electronics for testing and implementation inside my car.
